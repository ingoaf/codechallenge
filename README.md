## FAQ

### Do i have to finish all or all assigned challenges?

No! It is not mandatory to finish all challenges, we assigned you for.
We just want to learn, how you solve problems. Even if you get stuck and aren't able to finish a single challenge, just search other ways to describe, how you would solve the problem.

### Can i get help somewhere, while doing the challenges?

Yes! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask your contact person. We are happy to help you out.
Asking questions is important, you shouldn't spent to much time, if you are stuck.
